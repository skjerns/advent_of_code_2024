thb this year I did not have time at all to run this properly, so please dear recruiter, don't judge my coding skills on this repository :D

## Runtime statistics

I did not optimize my code for performance, but here are the numbers on a AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 6850U with 32 GB RAM. Runtimes exclude imports and reading from disk/network. I'll only resort to parallelization once the runtimes are above 5 minutes.

| Day | Title                                                        | Runtime |

Note, puzzle input is different for participants and I've seen 50% increase in runtime for other puzzles input, so the runtimes are user-specific.
